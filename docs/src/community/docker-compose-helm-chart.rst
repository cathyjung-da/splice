Docker Compose and Helm Chart Deployment
========================================

This guide introduces a community-contributed Docker Compose solution for deploying Canton validator nodes and supporting infrastructure, following the ``x-docker`` standard used by Mario Delgadoâ€™s team for onboarding blockchains. 
This solution emphasizes extensibility, operational flexibility, and integration with broader infrastructure. 
For a simpler, more minimal setup, refer to :ref:`Docker Compose-Based Deployment of a Validator Node <compose_validator>`.

Thanks to Mario Delgado for sharing this solution in a `community discussion <https://daholdings.slack.com/archives/C08AP9QR7K4/p1748679114726079>`_. 
For more details and future updates, see the `CryptoManufaktur-io/canton-docker <https://github.com/CryptoManufaktur-io/canton-docker>`_ repository.

Key Features of This Solution
-----------------------------

- Custom Docker Compose setup for Canton, aligning with ``x-docker`` standards.
- Validator migration support via ``validator-migration.yaml`` for upgrades.
- Automated installation and update scripts for setup and maintenance.
- Support for custom overrides (``custom.yml``) and environment variables, enabling advanced configuration without modifying the base files.
- Integration guidance for Traefik (proxy) and Prometheus (monitoring) via ``central-proxy-docker`` and ``:ext-network.yml``.
- Experimental Helm chart for Kubernetes environments (in progress).
- Disaster recovery features (in progress).
